# Translations
When a new command is made, I *usually* make it's respective translations in the same commit, if not, maybe im just lazy.

The fallback language when no translation found is `en-US`

# It's not a bug, it's a feature
- Some errors can be ephemeral or not

# Self-hosting
Zeyr team does not support the idea of people self-hosting their own instance of Zeyr, we kindly ask you to use our self-hosted version.

# Older version
If you want Zeyr's old code (not that old, still used) please refer to [brxem/zeyr](https://github.com/brxem/zeyr), eventually that repo wont be updated anymore, please stay up-to-date üôè
